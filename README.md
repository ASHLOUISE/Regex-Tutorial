# Understanding Regular Expressions

Regular expressions (regex) are powerful tools for pattern matching and text processing. They allow you to define patterns to search for and manipulate text efficiently. This README provides an overview of various components of regular expressions and their functions.

## Anchors

Anchors are special characters used to assert positions within the text. They include:

- `\b`: Matches a word boundary, ensuring that the match occurs at the beginning or end of a word.

## Quantifiers

Quantifiers control the number of occurrences of a character or group in a regex pattern. They include:

- `+`: Specifies that the preceding character set should occur one or more times.
- `{2,}`: Specifies that the preceding character set should occur at least two or more times.

## Grouping Constructs

Grouping constructs allow you to treat multiple characters as a single unit. They are represented by parentheses `( )`.

## Bracket Expressions

Bracket expressions, also known as character classes, define a set of characters that can match at a particular position in the text.

## Character Classes

Character classes are similar to bracket expressions and define a set of characters that can match at a particular position in the text.

## The OR Operator

The OR operator allows you to specify alternative matches. It is represented by the pipe symbol `|`.

## Flags

Flags are additional parameters that can be added to a regex pattern to modify its behavior.

## Character Escapes

Character escapes allow you to match characters with special meanings in regex as literals. They are represented by the backslash `\`.
